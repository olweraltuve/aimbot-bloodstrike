## ‚ùì What Is an AI Aimbot?

Lunar uses screen capture + YOLO object detection to locate enemies in real-time.

> It doesn‚Äôt touch memory or inject code ‚Äî think of it as a robot that watches your screen and gives you precise X,Y coordinates of targets.

üéØ Preconfigured for **Fortnite** ‚Äî some sensitivity tuning may be needed for other games.

Lunar LITE works with:
- [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)

<summary>‚öôÔ∏è <strong>Usage / Troubleshooting</strong></summary>

### If you get `CUDA IS UNAVAILABLE` error:
1. Make sure your installed CUDA version matches.
2. Visit [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and install the right build.

Command for CUDA 12.6:
```
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```

### If the aimbot only works when you Alt+Tab (doesn't work in-game):

**‚ö†Ô∏è This is the MOST COMMON issue - the problem is screen capture, not mouse movement.**

**üîß Solution (Already Implemented):**

The code now uses **BitBlt** by default, which works with fullscreen games. Just verify:
- Open `lib/config/mouse_config.py`
- Confirm: `CAPTURE_METHOD = 'bitblt'`

**Alternative Solutions:**
1. **Change game to BORDERLESS WINDOWED mode** (most reliable)
   - Go to game settings ‚Üí Display/Video
   - Change from "Fullscreen" to "Borderless Windowed"

2. **Use auto-detection mode:**
   - In `lib/config/mouse_config.py`
   - Change: `CAPTURE_METHOD = 'auto'`

---

### If the aimbot detects targets but doesn't move the mouse:

**The code now uses DDXoft by default (kernel-level, less detectable).**

**If DDXoft driver doesn't work on your system:**

1. **Verify DDXoft is available:**
   - Check that `lib/mouse/dd40605x64.dll` exists
   - If missing, download from the original Lunar repository

2. **Fallback to Win32 if needed:**
   - Open `lib/config/mouse_config.py`
   - Change: `MOUSE_METHOD = 'win32'`
   - **WARNING:** Win32 is more detectable by anti-cheat

3. **Adjust sensitivity if needed:**
   - Edit `lib/config/config.json`
   - Lower `targeting_scale` for smoother movement
   - Higher values = faster/more aggressive

üìñ See `SOLUCION_MOUSE_MOVEMENT.md` for detailed troubleshooting guide.

---

### If the console closes instantly:
```
python lunar.py
```

---

### To configure sensitivity:
```
python lunar.py setup
```

---

### To collect training images:
```
python lunar.py collect_data
```
